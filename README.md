# Portfolio

My portfolio as a full stack developer, showcasing my best work and the technologies I'm most comfortable with. 

I built this during an advanced CSS course. The designs were provided by the course over at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio).

## Technologies used

* CSS3
* HTML5


## Description

My personal portfolio, a single static page, highlighting my work as a developer. Some features include:

* A fully responsive design. Desktop, tablet, and mobile views each have their own layout.

* Use of the HTML <Picture> element, allowing for different images of me to be used depending on the size of the device. This creates a nice aesthetic using an appropriate crop of an image.

* Each project stands out as its own card.

* Each card includes a screenshot, a general description, a technical description, a quick list of technologies used, and links to the project's website and repository.
