# My Portfolio

This was a project I completed during an advanced CSS course. It's a single static page highlighting my best work. It's fully responsive and desktop, tablet, and mobile views each have their own design. The designs were provided by the course over at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio).

I keep this project updated to showcase my work.
